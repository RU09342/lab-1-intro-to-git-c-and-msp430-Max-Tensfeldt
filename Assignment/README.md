Math.c README file

The file math.c contains the simple function of math(). 
The function will have three inputs, two numbers as integers 
and a character that will be either an addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division, or modulus operator input. Any other 
character that is inserted into the function will result in an error message.

operator input with every mathematical operation symbol mentioned above. 
The requested operator is applied to the two integer inputs and returned.

Addition +
Subtraction –
Multiplication *
Division /
Modulus %

Valid inputs for numbers are any real number however any decimal number will be truncated to an integer.
